Simple Network Management Protocol

manager-agent protocol
	agents are remote devices on the network	
		switches, generators, printers, routers, etc.

setup
	configure agent with managers IP address
	compile agent's Management Information Base (MIB) into the manager
		MIBs tell the manager about things like toner levels in printers or temperature in generators


SNMP elements are represented using Object Identifiers(OID)
	strings of dot seperated numbers
	each number adds detail (like in ip addresses - first number is a category, 2nd number is specifics)
	example OID - "1.3.6.1.4.1.2682.1.2.102"
	1.3.6.1.4.1... means enterprise SNMP equipment
	subsequent numbers 
		mean DPS Telecom (manufacturer)
		"Alarm monitoring equipment"
		RTU
		Alarm point 2

SNMP messages
	TRAP, GET, GET-NEXT, GET-RESPONSE, and SET
	used to communicate btwn. agent and manager

	TRAPs
		alert messages used to report happenings
		give manager a bigger picture of the whole network
		ex. industrial fridge sends TRAP when temperature gets too high

	GET
		allows manager to ask agent for status without having to wait for a trap
		lets manager tell if agent is still online


	GET-RESPONSE
		agent sends back this message in response to the GET request
	
	GET-NEXT
		if manager needs additional info after agent sends GET-RESPONSE, it sends this message
		can send as many times as needed to get all the data

	SET
		some agents have control relays and other things that can be controlled by manager
		state of these things can be changed using the SET message
		targets a specific OID


versions
	v1
		workstation that hosts the network management app
		polls management agents for information and provides control info to agents
		provides info contained in the MIB to management applications and may accept control information
	v2
		manager to manager communication to support multiple / distributed managers and mid-level managers.
		better security (known as "Secure SNMP") by specifying three layers of security.
		improved efficiency and performance through the addition of bulk transfers of data.
	v3
		includes encryption
